We will work from create-react-app in the workshop.\n\nIn this workshop we will build a small application (but not too trivial) application from scratch. We start by modelling our state after the mental picture we have from the problem. After that we define the operations we want to perform on the state, and define which information we want to derive from the state.\nWe will start small, and then discover that the very same principles apply to rendering our UI (using react), authentication, routing, testing, async processes. After this workshop you should have gathered enough knowledge to build real life applications based on MobX and the underlying reactive principles.\n\nTopics:\n\n* Introduction.\n* Setup\n* ES6 / ES.Next recap: arrow functions, classes, decorators, field initializers\n* Introduction to MobX, why MobX for state management?\n* MobX basics: observable, computed, autorun & action\n* Modelling domain state: stores, models, actions\n* Testing state & logic, JEST, snapshots\n* Building reactive user interface: observer (+ testing)\n* Recap: How does MobX track changes?\n* Using Provider / inject to pass stores through deeply nested interfaces\n* Fetching & storing data (+ testing)\n* Routing & authentication\n* Form validations\n* Conclusion",

            "description": "With the advent of libraries like React, Redux and Immutable.js, it's clear that there's a shift away from imperative and object-oriented in the front-end towards a more declarative and functional approach. Meanwhile, libraries like RxJS and Mobx are spreading the use of Reactive Programming to model UIs via discrete, asynchronous event streams. How can we combine the best of both functional and reactive paradigms to model and build predictable UIs that control themselves?\n\nIn this talk, Preethi will explain what “Functional Reactive Programming” is, how close React / Redux / Mobx / RxJs and others come in realizing Functional Reactive Programming, and what's still fundamentally missing from these tools to achieve a true implementation of FRP. Lastly, she'll describe when and why  FRP is suitable (or not suitable) for building predictable and scalable UIs.",

Both Redux and MobX sprung from the React community and provide stand-alone, generic state management solutions. Both have gained big in popularity, and both have their own strengths and weaknesses. What can we learn from both approaches? Can we get the best of both worlds? Can we add a little Boabab and Cerebral to the mix? Is it possible to create a transparent reactive, snapshotable state container. With support for JSON patches, replayable actions, serialization, complex object graphs. With Redux & MobX compatibility, strong typing and runtime type checks out of the box. Get a glimpse of what next-gen state management might look like with mobx-state-tree. Largely designed by the MobX community and enforcing many best practices that have evolved over the last year.",
